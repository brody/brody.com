Design is always going to be a competitive advantage. By sweating the details, you can create a product that is so good, users don't want to leave.

[Christina Wodtke](https://christinawodtke.com/blog/2025/11/20/ux-is-your-moat), writing on her blog:

> The most useful model might not win.
>
> What wins is the model that people don’t want to leave. The one that feels like home. The one where switching would mean losing something—not just access to features, but fluency, comfort, all those intangible things that make a tool feel like yours.
>
> Amazon figured this out with Prime. Apple figured it out with the ecosystem. Salesforce figured it out by making itself so embedded in enterprise workflows that ripping it out would require an act of God.
>
> AI companies are still acting like this is a pure technology competition. It’s not. It’s a competition to become essential—and staying power comes from experience, not raw capability.
>
> Your moat isn’t your model. Your moat is whether users feel at home.
