A very well crafted essay from [Nikita Prokopov](https://tonsky.me/blog/tahoe-icons/).

If you’ve looked at MacOS 26 Tahoe, you’re surely appalled by the new UI guideline that recommends putting icons next to every single menu item.

Prokopov argues — with copious screenshot illustrations every step of the way — that this is a terrible idea in the first place, and that Apple has implemented it poorly.
