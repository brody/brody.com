description: "Released in 2000, Eminem's song \"Stan\" -- about an obsessive, unstable fan -- remains iconic. So iconic that the term stan was officially added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2017. In the song, the titular character handwrites a series of emotional letters to Eminem, repeating the line: I'm just like you. That refrain serves as a guiding light for this unconventional and fully authorized feature, which follows a highly curated cast of real-life stans whose deep personal connections to Eminem mirror some of the themes found throughout his lyrics. More than just an exploration of fandom, the film examines the complicated relationship between one of the world's most private artists and his massive public persona. Through stylized recreations, rare archival footage, intimate interviews, and an exclusive original interview with Eminem himself, it offers a raw, loud, and revealing journey across his career -- and the passionate audience that has grown with him."
