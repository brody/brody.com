description: A deeper look at how design and engineering meet, overlap, and translate meaning — and why a shared language of making is the only way to build real shipping velocity.

For a long time, I've been dipping my toe across to the "engineering rail" to help guide the implmentation in code but it's more and more obvious that my impact would be greatest if I made a more intentional move to overlap both rails.

[Yann-Edern Gillet](https://yannglt.com/writing/the-rosetta-stone-of-design-engineering), writing on his blog:
> The real Rosetta Stone didn’t solve languages, it overlapped them. Same meaning, carved three times, so people could decode one through the other. Design engineering is the same: we’re constantly trying to express intent twice — once visually, once in code, without losing the meaning in between.⁠￼
>
> Design engineering isn’t about merging roles. It’s not about “one person doing everything.” It’s about live translation.⁠￼
>
> The job isn’t to switch sides. It’s to stay on the track and keep both rails aligned. It’s not about roles, it’s about function.⁠￼
