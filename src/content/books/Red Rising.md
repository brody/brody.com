description: "\"I live for the dream that my children will be born free,\" she says. \"That they will be what they like. That they will own the land their father gave them.\"\"I live for you,\" I say sadly.Eo kisses my cheek. \"Then you must live for more.\"Darrow is a Red, a member of the lowest caste in the color-coded society of the future. Like his fellow Reds, he works all day, believing that he and his people are making the surface of Mars livable for future generations.Yet he spends his life willingly, knowing that his blood and sweat will one day result in a better world for his children.But Darrow and his kind have been betrayed.
