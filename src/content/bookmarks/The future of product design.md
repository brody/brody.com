The craft bar keeps rising. Good is no longer good enough, and taste becomes leverage. Designers, PMs & engineers with strong product taste will stand out.

[Tom Scott](https://verifiedinsider.substack.com/p/the-future-of-product-design) writes on his blog:

> 1. AI is making the best designers more productive
> 2. Hands-on is the new default, regardless of level
> 3. You need to be fluent in systems NOT just pixels
> 4. The role of a 'designer' will shift to being a curator.
> 5. Show actual work to find a new job
> 6. Design/eng/product roles are merging QUICK
